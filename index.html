                <h3>What is Medical Negligence?</h3>
                <p>All healthcare professionals have a duty of care towards their patients. They must provide a certain standard of care to their patients, failure to provide care in line with this standard, which then results in an avoidable injury, is medical negligence.</p>

            <div class="whatIs-p1 hidden">
                <h4>How can a healthcare professional breach their duty of care?</h4>
                <p>This can happen in many ways, perhaps you were misdiagnosed? Given the incorrect medication? Maybe your urgent treatment was delayed without good reason? These are only a few of the ways in which a healthcare professional can breach their duty of care.</p>

                <h4>No Win No Fee</h4>
